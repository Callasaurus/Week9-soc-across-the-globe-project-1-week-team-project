## Color Reference

| Color             | Hex                                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Darker colour | ![#1A1B41](https://via.placeholder.com/10/1A1B41?text=+) #1A1B41 |
| Lighter colour| ![#C2E7DA](https://via.placeholder.com/10/C2E7DA?text=+) #C2E7DA |

We choose these colours to help with accessibility so the app truely was for all. We also checked how these colours worked with colour blind things.
