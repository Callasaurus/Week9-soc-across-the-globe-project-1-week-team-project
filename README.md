## Color Reference

| Color             | Hex                                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Darker colour | #1A1B41 |
| Lighter colour| #C2E7DA |

We choose these colours to help with accessibility so the app was suitable for all. We also checked to make sure that the colour scheme was appropriate for those with colour blindness.
